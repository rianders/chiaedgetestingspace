    "# CHI@Edge: Using camera peripherals\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the CHI@Edge devices have attached camera modules (e.g., the Raspberry Pi V2 camera). You can reserve these devices and launch containers on them and specify an additional `device_profiles` argument to request that your container have access to a particular attached device/peripheral. The current list of supported peripherals is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `pi_camera`: for accessing the Raspberry Pi camera module from a container running on a Raspberry Pi.\n",
    "- `jetson_csi_camera`: for accessing the Raspberry Pi camera module (or any other CSI-attached camera) from a container running on a Jetson.\n",
    "- `pi_gpio`: for accessing the GPIO port of the Raspberry Pi.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following example we'll show how to use either the Raspberry Pi or the Jetson to capture camera data and stream it to the Jupyter notebook. We will create a container that exposes the camera stream data via an HTTP interface, but this is not the only way to access that data; the important part is that the container can read the device just as if the code was running directly on the host.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll set up some parameters that we'll use for both the lease request and the container create."
